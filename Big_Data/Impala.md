Impala (Hadoop SQL) is the open source, native analytic database for Apache Hadoop. It is shipped by vendors such as Cloudera, MapR, Oracle, and Amazon.
Impala is used to process huge volumes of data at lightning-fast speed using traditional SQL knowledge.

Impala is a MPP (Massive Parallel Processing) SQL query engine for processing huge volumes of data that is stored in Hadoop cluster. It is an open source software which is written in C++ and Java. It provides high performance and low latency compared to other SQL engines for Hadoop.
In other words, Impala is the highest performing SQL engine (giving RDBMS-like experience) which provides the fastest way to access data that is stored in Hadoop Distributed File System.

Unlike Apache Hive, Impala is not based on MapReduce algorithms. It implements a distributed architecture based on daemon processes that are responsible for all the aspects of query execution that run on the same machines.

Thus, it reduces the latency of utilizing MapReduce and this makes Impala faster than Apache Hive.

Written in C++, unlike Hive which is written in Java!
